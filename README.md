3.	Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
a.	Waterfall: 
•	Description: A linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next.   
•	Advantages: Clear documentation, predictable timelines (in theory), suitable for stable requirements.
•	Disadvantages: Inflexible, difficult to adapt to changes, late detection of errors.

b.	Agile: 
•	Description: An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration.   
•	Advantages: Adaptable to changes, frequent feedback, faster delivery of working software.   
•	Disadvantages: Less predictable timelines, requires strong collaboration, can be challenging for large projects.


4.	In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
a.	Agile: 
•	Projects: Software development for dynamic markets, projects with evolving requirements, innovative products.
•	Examples: Mobile app development, web application development, startups.

b.	Waterfall: 
•	Projects: Projects with well-defined and stable requirements, safety-critical systems, large-scale infrastructure projects.
•	Examples: Government projects, aerospace systems, medical device software.


5.	What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
•	Here are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project: 
•	Code Reviews: Peer reviews to identify defects.   
•	Testing: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing.
•	Automated Testing: Using tools to automate testing processes.
•	Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Automating the build, test, and deployment process.   
•	Here are why it is important to maintain high standards: 
•	Reliability: Ensures the software functions as intended.
•	Customer Satisfaction: Reduces defects and improves user experience.   
•	Maintainability: Makes it easier to update and maintain the software.   
•	Security: Reduces vulnerabilities.

6.	How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
•	Defining the project scope, defines the boundaries of the project, preventing scope creep and ensuring everyone is aligned on what will be delivered.
•	A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
•	A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is useful as it provides a clear understanding of the project's components, facilitates task assignment, and enables accurate estimation.

7.	What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
•	Here are the benefits of a detailed project schedule: 
•	Clarity: Provides a roadmap for the project.
•	Resource Management: Helps allocate resources effectively.
•	Progress Tracking: Enables monitoring of progress against the schedule.
•	Communication: Facilitates communication among stakeholders.
•	Gantt charts assist in this process by giving visual representation of the project schedule, showing tasks, durations, and dependencies.

8.	What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
•	Here are some core issues addressed by a collaborative project management tool designed for remote teams:
•	Lack of Centralized Communication: 
o	Remote teams often struggle with fragmented communication across various platforms (email, instant messaging, etc.). This leads to missed information, confusion, and decreased efficiency.
o	The software aims to provide a single, unified platform for all project-related communication.
•	Difficulty in Task and Progress Tracking: 
o	Without a clear overview, it's challenging to track task assignments, deadlines, and progress. This can result in missed deadlines, duplicated work, and project delays.
o	The software aims to offer robust task management features, visual progress tracking (e.g., Kanban boards, Gantt charts), and automated reporting.
•	Challenges in Collaboration and File Sharing: 
o	Sharing and managing files across remote locations can be cumbersome. Version control issues and difficulty in providing feedback can hinder collaboration.
o	The software aims to provide integrated file sharing, version control, and real-time collaboration tools.
•	Time Zone Differences and Asynchronous Work: 
o	Remote teams often operate across different time zones, requiring effective asynchronous communication and collaboration.
o	The software aims to facilitate asynchronous communication, provide clear task assignments and deadlines, and offer features that support flexible work schedules.
•	Maintaining Team Cohesion and Morale: 
o	Remote work can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
o	The software could contain features that promote team cohesion, such as team virtual spaces, or easy ways to give positive feed back to other team members.
•	Here are some of the significance of these problems  to Target Audience:
